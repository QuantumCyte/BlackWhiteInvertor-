# BlackWhiteInvertor-
Tool that takes a printfile png from printmatch, and inverts the colours. 
Use case:
Can switch black and white so user can choose whether to mask ROIs or not. 

Files:
BlackWhiteInvertorAPPLICATION.py, file that contains code to convert and UI. Use this to convert files. 
BlackWhiteInvertorCode.ipynb, separate file that has just the code that converts files. Ignore this. The application file above has the same thing. This was created just to see the code without the UI elements. 

How to use: 
After putting code on local machine, run "BlackWhiteInvertorAPPLICATION.py"
A tkinter pop up will open. In order from left to right, choose printfile to be inverted, click save to and choose where to save the new inverted printfile, press convert.
