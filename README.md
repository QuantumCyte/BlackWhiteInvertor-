# BlackWhiteInvertor-
Tool that takes a printfile png from printmatch, and inverts the colours. 
Use case:
Can switch black and white so user can choose whether to mask ROIs or not. 

How to use: 
After putting code on local machine, run "BlackWhiteInvertorAPPLICATION.py"
A tkinter pop up will open. In order from left to right, choose printfile to be inverted, click save to and choose where to save the new inverted printfile, press convert.
